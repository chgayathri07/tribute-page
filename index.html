				<p>Keller was born on June 27, 1880, in Tuscumbia, Alabama. At 19 months old, Keller contracted an unknown illness described by doctors as "an acute congestion of the stomach and the brain".Contemporary doctors believe it may have been meningitis, caused by the bacterium Neisseria meningitidis (meningococcus),or possibly Haemophilus influenzae, which can cause the same symptoms but is less likely because of its 97% juvenile mortality rate at that time.She was able to recover from her illness, but was left permanently blind and deaf, as she recalled in her autobiography, "at sea in a dense fog".At that time, Keller was able to communicate somewhat with Martha Washington, who was two years older and the daughter of the family cook, and understood the girl's signs,by the age of seven, Keller had more than 60 home signs to communicate with her family, and could distinguish people by the vibration of their footsteps.Keller became a world-famous speaker and author. She was an advocate for people with disabilities, amid numerous other causes. She traveled to twenty-five different countries giving motivational speeches about Deaf people's conditions.She was a suffragist, pacifist, radical socialist, birth control supporter, and opponent of Woodrow Wilson. In 1915, she and George A. Kessler founded the Helen Keller International (HKI) organization. This organization is devoted to research in vision, health, and nutrition. In 1916, she sent money to the NAACP, as she was ashamed of the Southern un-Christian treatment of "colored people".</p>

            <ul class="font" style="text-align: justify;">Helen Keller wrote about her life in several books, including The Story of My Life (1903), Optimism (1903), The World I Live In (1908), My Religion (1927), Helen Kellerâ€™s Journal (1938), and The Open Door (1957).On September 14, 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson awarded her the Presidential Medal of Freedom, one of the United States' two highest civilian honors. In 1965, she was elected to the National Women's Hall of Fame at the New York World's Fair.An anime movie called The Story of Helen Keller: Angel of Love and Light was made in 1981.[72]

                In 1984, Keller's life story was made into a TV movie called The Miracle Continues.This film, a semi-sequel to The Miracle Worker, recounts her college years and her early adult life. None of the early movies hint at the social activism that would become the hallmark of Keller's later life, although a Disney version produced in 2000 states in the credits that she became an activist for social equality.
                
                The Bollywood movie Black (2005) was largely based on Keller's story, from her childhood to her graduation.
                
                A documentary called Shining Soul: Helen Keller's Spiritual Life and Legacy was produced by the Swedenborg Foundation in the same year. The film focuses on the role played by Emanuel Swedenborg's spiritual theology in her life and how it inspired Keller's triumph over her triple disabilities of blindness, deafness and a severe speech impediment.
